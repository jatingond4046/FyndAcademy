        <h1>Bold VS Strong tag</h1>
        <p>Both tags are formatting tags and used to <b>bold</b> the text but bold tag is usually used to bold the topic
            or
            headings or subheadings and <strong>strong</strong> tag is used to draw the attention towards the text that
            it
            is important</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p><b>Introduction :</b> My name is <strong>Jatin Kumar</strong> and I live in <strong>katni</strong></p>
        <p>Here Introduction is jsut heading so it is covered with <b>bold</b> tag and Jatin kumar is the name so it is
            important so it is covered with <strong>strong</strong> tag</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Strike VS Delete tag</h1>
        <p>The delete tag defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line
            through
            deleted text.</p>
        <p>Use the strike element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate</p>
        <h3>Example : </h3>
        <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>!</p>
        <p><s>There will be a few tickets available at the box office tonight.</s></p>
        <p>SOLD OUT!</p>
